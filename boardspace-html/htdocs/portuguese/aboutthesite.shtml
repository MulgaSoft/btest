<h1 style="text-align: center;">About the Site</h1>
<ul>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Who runs the site?</span><br>
Boardspace.net is a hobby, not a
commercial site under
development, not a technology demonstration for a software
company.&nbsp; There is no hidden catch.&nbsp; Just enjoy it as my
guest.&nbsp; My home page is <a style="font-weight: normal;"
 href="http://www.real-me.net/ddyer/">here</a><span
 style="font-weight: normal;">.</span></li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Why Z&egrave;rtz? Why Yinsh? Why
Punct? Why Dvonn? Why Tzaar?<br>
    </span></li>
I was originally hooked into playing Z&egrave;rtz on
Richard's<a href="http://www.gamerz.net/"> PBEM server</a>, using <a
 href="http://assimilate.int.webmatrixhosting.net/zf1/">Z&egrave;rtz
for One</a>
as a study tool to plan moves.&nbsp;&nbsp; It's great to spend hours
planning
perfect sequences, but face to face games are another thing
entirely.&nbsp; I waited a year for a direct play site to emerge.&nbsp;
When none did, I fell off the deep end and did it myself.&nbsp; <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Kris Burm, </span>the inventor, is not
directly
involved, but knows about the site and approves. Likewise, <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Michael Reitz</span> (who wrote ZF1)&nbsp;
has provided some useful feedback, but isn't directly involved with the
design or implementation of this site.&nbsp;&nbsp; <span
 style="font-weight: bold;"></span>The remaining games in
project GIPF are strong candidates to be added to the site eventually.<br>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Why Lines of Action?<br>
    </span><a href="/loa/">Lines
of Action</a>
was a game I had played some, but knew little about, and knew no one
else that played it.&nbsp; Way back when the Internet first exploded on
the public
consciousness,&nbsp; I adopted Lines of Action as project.&nbsp; I
developed an applet to play and review games, and a home page
to consolidate all known information about the game.&nbsp; It was
always
my desire to have
a place to
play it online.&nbsp; It just took a while.</li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Why Plateau?<br>
    </span>The
thing that attracts me to <a href="http://www.plateaugame.com/">Plateau</a>
is that it is as much a
psychological&nbsp; game as it is a strategic and tactical one.&nbsp;
The concealed information makes the threat matrix uncomputable - there
are no safe plays or sure winning strategies. Plateau is a really fine
game that deserves a wider audience. <br>
  </li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Why Hex?</span><br>
Hex is one of those classic games that no one seems to actually
play.&nbsp; Imagine my surprise that it's actually a very interesting
game, especially to a Go player.&nbsp; Hex reminds me of the a sequence
in <span style="font-style: italic;">Creatures of Light and
Darkness.&nbsp; </span>(extra
points if you can tell me which one, and why.)<br>
  </li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Why Trax?</span></li>
Trax is another under appreciated classic game.&nbsp; It's been around
a while, and has a following.&nbsp; It's probably better analyzed than
any other game played here; and the good players are <span
 style="font-style: italic;">good </span>not just amateurs who are a
little more advanced.&nbsp;&nbsp; Oh yea, and my friends from
Tantrix.com are distributing the tiles, so I hope for a little
cross-site traffic.<br>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;"> Why Gobblet?<br>
    </span>Gobblet was an not-quite accidental discovery - my wife gave
it to me for Christmas. Among a bunch of games I've acquired randomly
in
the last couple years, it's the clear winner as the most fun, light
abstract.&nbsp; So there you are.</li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;"> Why Hive?<br>
    </span>Hive made the cut because in addition to being a first rate
and highly rated new game, it seemed to inspire fanatics far beyond the
oh-yea-its-a-good-game variety.&nbsp; Game fanatics deserve to be
rewarded.</li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Why Exxit?</span><br>
Exxit grabbed my attention at BoiteAJeux, a turn based site.&nbsp; It's
a frustratingly difficult game for such simple rules.&nbsp; In other
words; just the kind of thing I like., I think Exxit has huge potential.</li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Why Tablut?<br>
    </span>It's a classic - literally - having been played for over
1000 years.&nbsp;&nbsp; A modern variant called Breakthru was a
favorite of mine.&nbsp; This is in the class of games which definitely
ought to be more widely known.</li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Why Dipole?<br>
    </span>Mark Steere's austere approach to game design results in
real gamer's games: finite, unforgiving of errors, and begging for
in-depth study.&nbsp; Dipole is his best yet.</li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Why Tumblingdown?<br>
    </span>Someone pointed out the similarity of Tumblingdown's move
mechanic to Exxit, and it turned out to be a first rate game which was
invented and promptly forgotten.</li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Why Truchet?<br>
    </span>There's no doubt: my attraction is to the tiles. <br>
  </li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Why Fanorona?<br>
    </span>I was intrigued by the novelty of the "capture by
withdrawal" mechanism, and the back story "national game of Madagascar"
helped too.&nbsp; Plus I can see an emerging category of classic
abstracts - so far containing Tablut, Lines of Action, and Fanorona.</li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Why Volcano?<br>
    </span>Icehouse pieces!&nbsp; They're so nice looking,&nbsp; and so
versatile, they deserve a place in every abstract gamer's shelf.&nbsp;
Volcano is my current favorite icehouse game, and also one of the less
frequently played since it requires 6 stashes. <br>
  </li>
  <li><b>Why Traboulet?</b><br>
Traboulet came to my attention on a BGG geeklist for games with unique
mechanisms. It proved to be
hard to find, fun to play, and the inventor has a compelling story to
tell about his struggle
to with the publisher of similar-looking <i>Abalone</i>.</li>
  <li><b>Why Qyshinsu?<br>
    </b>Qyshinsu is definitely one of my odder choices.&nbsp; It
started as a suggestion on the "proposed games" geeklist.&nbsp; It
definitely helped that there was already a Zillions implementation and
a turn based implementation at SuperDuperGames, so I was able to play a
few games and experience it's mind-twisting for myself.&nbsp; It
definitely helped that the developer sent me a free copy of the game
(this is the first time a free game has influenced my choice).</li>
  <li><b>Why knockabout?<br>
    </b>The dice-as-playing pieces paradigm is way cool.&nbsp; I've had
in mind to implement one of them since the beginning - knockabout
happens to be the first one to make it out the door.&nbsp; Maybe more
later!<br>
  </li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">What's the Master Plan?</span>&nbsp;
The plan is to build the site into a place where you can
drop in anytime for a game.&nbsp; Under&nbsp; reasonable assumptions,
it
takes (only) about 200 regular players to reach the point where you
will probably encounter another player in the lobby within a few
minutes.&nbsp;&nbsp; Unfortunately, the number 200 is separate for each
game, so having lots of games doesn't directly help.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Getting to 200 will be hard.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Meantime, bring your own opponent.</li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">More Games! Better&nbsp; Robots!
Better Graphics! </span>etc. etc. etc.&nbsp; I'm always interested in
suggestions, especially suggestions with a lot of support in the player
community. Easy things and things that really grab my attention are
much more likely to be implemented.&nbsp;&nbsp; If you want to
help,&nbsp; lets talk.</li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">What does it take to make a site
like this?&nbsp; </span>No actual spit or baling wire is involved.
Here's <a href="sitecomponents.html">the rundown</a>.<br>
