<H3>The "Scrambled Eggs" variation</H3>

<p>The <EM>Scrambled Eggs</EM>

variation was invented by Claude Soucie himself,<br>

and named by John McCallion with Claude's approval. 

In the Scambled Eggs variation, Black and White pieces alternate, 

all around the board, with White at A2.

<p>

After the intial setup, the game proceeds normally

<h3>The "Parachute" variation</h3>

<p>The &quot;parachute&quot; variation starts with half the stones in the &quot;Scrambled Eggs&quot; setup, 

conventionally the left-and-right  half, with white at a2.  Each player starts with six of his opponent's stones 

in reserve.  The first six moves consist of making a regular move and placing one of the <STRONG>opponent's</STRONG> 

stones, <STRONG>anywhere on the board</STRONG>.

<p>After the first six moves, the game continues normally.



The <EM>Parachute</EM> variation was invented during a NOSTvention, by David Voorhees, 

while in a restaurant waiting to be served.  (No information 

is available whether the proverbial cocktail napkin was involved) 

The first game was played on the spot, using a portable Chess 

board that happened to be handy.

Described by John McCallion in NOST #358, and inspired by &quot;Cheshire Cat&quot; chess. 

The standard starting position and the usual rules apply, with the following additions:

<ul>

<p>

<li>When a unit moves, <I>the vacated space disappears forever

</I>.  The hole it leaves can be crossed, but not landed on, by any subsequent move

<p>

<li>When a unit at any time is incapable of moving traditionally, it may be simply removed from 

the board, and its space vanishes.  This move constitutes a turn.

</ul>

<P>

Here, we have the inaugural game of Gemma, as commented by John McCallion.

<caption><h2>More Variations</h2></caption>

<center><h3>Four Handed LOA</h3></center>

<p>

In four handled LOA, one row of each color are marked 

in some way, so each player starts with six pieces, and 

can move only his own pieces.  Play alternates between 

teams and partners; the first team to connect all its 

pieces wins.

<p>

This variation was inspired by the German "Hexagames" LOA 

set, which has Fleur-de-Lis on one side of each piece.

<p>

</td>

<td>

<center><h3>Ambidextrous LOA</h3></center>

<p>

 Played exactly like four-handed LOA, except that only two 

players play.  In effect, each player has to alternate 

moving his two types of pieces.

<center><h3>Hamilton Circuit LOA</h3></center>

This isn't an official variant (what's &quot;official&quot; anyway?) 

but Andy McDaniel, co-author of the <A HREF="#loa-1.0">LOA 1.0 program</A><P> learned to play this way: 

<blockquote>

I learned about Lines of Action in 1977 from a letter 

from a friend. However, the rules had a modification. 

A winning position consisted of a chain of men connected 

in such a way that one could traverse all the men along 

the chain without repeating a man (in technical terms, 

the graph formed with the men as nodes and their adjacencies 

as edges must be a Hamiltonian graph). So a connected group 

that formed a Y shape would not be a win. Also a connected 

group of men could have a bubble in it that prevented it from 

being a win. ... I eventually tracked the game back to a friend of a friend, 

He used the standard rules, but I kept seeing ways to confine 

his group to Y shapes.

</blockquote>

<center><h3>Euler LOA</h3></center>

<p>As discussed in the <A HREF="loa-programmer.html#connectivity">Programmer's notes</A>, counting the groups 

to recognise winning positions is one of the more time consuming parts of a computer program to play&#59; but there 

is an elegant way to calculate the Euler number (number of groups, minus the number of holes) without any kind 

of search. So here's a brand new variant: 

<p><nl><li>a win is whenever a player's Euler number becomes one or less. 



<p>

<li>Therefore, all winning positions according to the standard rules would still be wins, but positions with 

two groups and a hole, three groups and <EM>two </EM> holes, and so on would also be wins.
