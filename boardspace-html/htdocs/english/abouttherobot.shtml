</h1>
Select the robot to play by clicking on <span
 style="font-style: italic;">select robot</span> next to the start
button.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
The robots are currently known as <span style="font-style: italic;">Dumbot</span>
<span style="font-style: italic;">Smartbot </span>and <span
 style="font-style: italic;">BestBot.&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Each game has
its own family of robots, and some are better players than others, but
generally <span style="font-style: italic;">Dumbot </span>plays well
enough to win against beginners, <span style="font-style: italic;">Smartbot
</span>in intended to play well enough to challenge intermediate skilll
players, and <span style="font-style: italic;">Bestbot </span>is the
best available, challenging even for advanced players.&nbsp;&nbsp; Some
games may not have any robot, or may not have all three.<br>
<br>
The robots are written in Java, and run on your machine rather than on
the server.&nbsp; Consequently, if the robot seems too slow, my first
suggestion is to buy a faster machine.&nbsp; I calibrate the robots'
speed and playing ability so they will respond at least as fast as a
typical human player.<br>
<br>
Robot games are scored just like regular games, and each robot has a
ranking for each game.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In <span
 style="font-style: italic;">ranked </span>robot games the player to
move first is random, and the games are remembered if you quit
them.&nbsp; Consequenly you can always quit to join a human player, and
come back to your robot game later, and also you can't get out of&nbsp;
eventually finishing a robot game you are losing.&nbsp; The robots are
happy to play <span style="font-style: italic;">unranked </span>games
and let you choose who will move first.<br>
<br>
If your opponent quits a game before it is over, you can let the robot
finish the game by clicking on the "actions" menu in the game
room.&nbsp; In these games, the robot's win or loss is credited to the
player who quit. <br>
